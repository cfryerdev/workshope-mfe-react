# Workshop: Basic Microfrontends in React
A workshop geared to help you create your first microfrontend using react and module federation. This course will give you the basics of the technology that makes it possible and how it all works together. All of the code will be operating in a monorepo for convenience and ease of adoption. 

### Time frame
This course should take 1-3 hours depending on your proficiency.

### Prerequisites 
- Intermediate hands on experience in React.
- Basic knowledge of Http Methods and javascript loading.

## ▪️ What is a Microfrontend Architecture?

Microfrontend architecture is an approach to breaking up your front-end into a set of independently deployable, loosely coupled applications and/or components. These applications are then assembled together to act as a single user experience, once deployed. We do this using a new technology called Module Federation. We have a single Host application which wraps up our single page applications represented as remotes.

### What are hosts and remotes?

When we talk about micro-frontends, we often use words like `HOST` and `REMOTE`. A host is a parent application that ties all remotes together. A remote can be many things, but in the context of what we will be learning, a remote is essentially a single page react application. 

Often time a host can extend configuration, security, types, routing, and many other features to remotes, so that each remote does not have to implement them individually.

### Solution Structure
For now we will keep the structure loose and simple:

```
├─── 📁 host                > React Host
│    ├─── 📁 layout         > Shared layout
│    └─── 📁 pages          > Routing
│
├─── 📁 remotes
│    ├─── 📁 home           > React Remote using JSX
│    ├─── 📁 profile        > React Remote using Typescript
│    └─── 📁 sample         > React Remote using JSX
```

## ▫️ Getting started

First off we want to create a default package to manage the solution using npm.
